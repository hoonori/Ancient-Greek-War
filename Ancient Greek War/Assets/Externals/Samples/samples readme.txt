I've included here a few examples of other asset sets I've created which go along with this tile set:

"Painted 2D Location Tiles: Medieval-Fantasy"    - http://u3d.as/oZ7
"Painted 2D Terrain Tiles: Cold Lands"           - http://u3d.as/wku
"Painted 2D Terrain Tiles: Deserts"              - http://u3d.as/KsD
"Painted 2D Terrain Tiles: Tropics and Wetlands" - http://u3d.as/12zU 
"Painted 2D Terrain Tiles: Volcanic Wastes"      - http://u3d.as/12Gt

Feel free to use any of these sample tiles as-is. If you think they're cool and want more, check out the sets on the Unity Asset Store at the links above!
